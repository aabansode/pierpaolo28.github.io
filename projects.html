    <h2 class="center"> Software Engineer </h2>
    <h3 class="center">AI enthusiast, fluent in Python, UIPATH and Web Development</h3>
    <p>I am a third-year student at the University of Southampton studying
      Electronic Engineering. I have a strong interest in AI advancements and
      machine learning applications (such as financial markets and medicine).
      Outside my degree course, I have also attended occasional courses on
      accounting and finance to expand my personal knowledge and took part in
      volunteering experiences.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">UIPath Data Scraping in Amazon </h2>
      <p>I created a web-scraping tool to open Chrome to loop through all the Amazon pages of a chosen category. 
        I can then store, for each article in the category, the name, price and link in a CSV file. Finally, 
        it is then possible to analyse this file (using python ML algorithms) to see how prices changes with time 
        and compare with different suppliers.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Hack the South - Best Hardware Design Prize Winner</h2>
      <p>This project consists of designing and building a voice-activated autonomous robot. 
        The intuitiveness of our robot makes it ideal for general public use. 
        The tasks it can accomplish bring great value to its users and particularly for assisting impaired people. <br>
        The demonstration my group provided during this hackathon consisted of locating a drink and serving it to its user. 
        However, the robot is not limited to this task and has the potential to empower the population with its wide variety 
        of applications. <br>
        The robot harnesses a multitude of different technologies such as voice-assistive technology using Google cloud’s 
        Google Assistant API or the machine learning techniques that allow it to detect various object and faces. <br>
        The program for the robot is executed on a raspberry pi coupled with an Arduino to allow a low consumption of power. 
        The efficiency of our robot results in low cost and small environmental impact. <br>
        The raspberry-pi is used to perfect the voice recognition of the system as well as the field vision. 
        The Arduino board is used to power the servo motors and serial communications. Although the main chassis of 
        the robot was built using the inventor fit for RedBot, 3D printed parts were tailored for the task specifications. </p>

      <p>Creation of Jarvis Smart Lamp, capable to regulate itself the light brightness intensity according to how much light 
        detects in the environment around. Can be turned on and off just clapping your hands and can be integrated with Alexa. </p>

      <p class="wrapper">This project consisted of developing an interactive whiteboard client/server that pairs of users can use to view pictures, 
        shapes, etc., drawn by each other on their respective Raspberry Pi’s. This involved implementing a suitable GUI for the send 
        and receive windows, devising a protocol to exchange drawings and physically communicating using the GPIO pins. </p>
