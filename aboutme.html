    <h2 class="center"> Software Engineer </h2>
    <h3 class="center">AI enthusiast, fluent in Python, UIPATH and Web Development</h3>
    <p>I am a third-year student at the University of Southampton studying
      Electronic Engineering. I have a strong interest in AI advancements and
      machine learning applications (such as financial markets and medicine).
      Outside my degree course, I have also attended occasional courses on
      accounting and finance to expand my personal knowledge and took part in
      volunteering experiences.</p>

        <li>Work Experience</li>
        <ul class="description" style="list-style-type:disc;">
          <li><em>ECS RESEARCH INTERN, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON</em> =
            My main role during this internship was to design the chip and board
            layout for a monolithic quantum dot-enhanced micro‐display demonstrator
            device. This project was carried out in collaboration with a University
            in Hong Kong to research how to improve the efficiency of next-generation
            Micro-LED displays.</li>
          <li><em>SPRING INTERN, BARCLAYS</em> =
            Attended an Insight Program for Barclays in Glasgow during which I had
            shadowing sessions for both roles of Developer and Business Analyst.
            Thanks to this experience I gained a greater understanding of the
            financial market and of the increasing impact technology is going to
            have in this environment (ex. AI, Open Banking, API, Big Data,
            Cybersecurity and Biometrics voice recognition)</li>
          <li><em>BUSINESS INNOVATION PROGRAMME, SAGAR  ENERGY SOLUTIONS</em> =
            Collaborated as part of the University of Southampton Business
            Innovation Programme with the company SAGAR ENERGY SOLUTIONS. On this
            occasion, I was working as a member of a group. The company hired us
            as a consultancy firm to propose new ideas about how to rebrand the
            company name, logo and website. My contribution consisted of creating
            different designs for their new website.</li>
          <li>Another occasion I worked as part of a team was when I worked for the
            Open Days, UCAS visit days and Career Fair of my University. I decided
            specifically to work for my department (Electronics and Computer Science).
            Over several Open Days, I was assigned different tasks, always as part of
            a team, including welcoming visitors to our buildings, showing them the
            lab facilities, and answering questions about course content and university
            life in general.</li>
