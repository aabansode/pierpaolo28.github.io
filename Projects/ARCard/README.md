# Augmented Reality (AR) Business Card

Creation of my personal Augmented Reality (AR) Business Card.  <br>

TODO link to marker + pdf version of business card and add video demonstration <br>

To use my card in Augmented reality version, just go to this 
[link](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/Projects/ARCard/arcard.html) and point your phone camera to the marker. <br> 

To interact with any of the menu items, just direct the pointer on them (by moving your camera) and wait for a few seconds. <br>

In order to create this repository I followed many tutorials and guides such as: <br>
